          <p class="lead">I am sincerely convinced that my educational background and professional experiences uniquely qualify me as an exceptional candidate for the position of 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal. My education in finance and my experiences in higher education administration as a college Bursar provide me with the necessary skill set to lead the charge in enhancing our record keeping practices and protocols within the 7th District of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.
          <br><br>
          For more than 20+ years I’ve had professional opportunities to develop and administer effective change within Corporate America, as well as within the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., which have included but are not limited to chapter operating procedures, record keeping structure within the state of Mississippi Organization,  the implementation of strategic initiatives that created a successful working relationship amongst committee chairman to achieve successful outcomes regarding objectives and goals.<br><br>Currently, my job as the Bursar for Tougaloo College, the chief financial administrator regarding student accounts offers significant qualifications for the position of Keeper of Records and Seal to the Mighty 7th District, in that my responsibilities involve the keeping of accurate records of tuition, fees, and other cash receipts as well as the disbursement of scholarship and loan funds for all students enrolled at Tougaloo College.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"><font color="#cfb53b">Why I am passionate about the position of 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal?<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          </font>
          <font color="#28033C">
          <p class="lead">
          My personal belief is that we can always improve on how we operate in Omega. If elected, it will be my job to first perform the duties prescribed in our 7th District and National bylaws to the best of my ability. During my tenure within the fraternity, I have considered myself one of the hardest working brothers in Omega. For the years that I was the FVSR (MS) and SKRS (MS), I tried to give the brotherhood the best I had to offer on all facets. Hopefully, I left these positions better than where I found them. As your next 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal, I want to help to improve versus alter a large number of processes currently in place. I know the brothers who have held this position in previous years worked hard but I believe my unique perspective on improvement and innovation will allow me to expand upon and increase the effectiveness of this position.
          <br><br>
          I promise you that, if I'm elected, I will aim to be the best 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal in Omega. Brothers, I also believe that I can bring more than just good ideas to the 7th DKRS position, but I can also provide innovative thinking and a brotherly spirit to the district council to help continue moving the district forward.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, my vast knowledge of fraternity policy and procedure, excellent communication skills, as well as my ability to accurately report organizational proceedings in a timely and effective manner, have prepared me to serve in such a demanding office as that of the 7th District Keeper of Records and Seal, which is often referred to as the <b>“BACKBONE” </b>of the fraternity.

I have held positions of leadership and influence at every level within the fraternity.
