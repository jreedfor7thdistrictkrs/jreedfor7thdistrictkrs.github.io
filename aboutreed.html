          <p class="lead">Brother James M. Reed IV (2-98-Xi Kappa Kappa), initiated on March 2nd, 1998. Over 17 consecutive, active years, I’ve held fraternal leadership positions from the chapter level to the district level. As a chapter Basileus, First Vice State Representative for Mississippi, and currently Seventh District Stop the Violence Prevention chairman,  my leadership skills have proven beneficial to the overall mission of the fraternity. As an executive officer for the State of MS Organization, I implemented effective and efficient change for the betterment of our beloved organization.   During my tenure as a Committee Chairman and International Committee member for the Stop the Violence Prevention, I have added valuable insight on effective approaches for dealing with internal and external violence that plagues our fraternity and our community at large.
          <br><br>
          My successful leadership experiences within the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., as well as with other organizations, serve as evidence of my ability to make a significant impact on the way our records are kept and our seal is protected. For more than 17 years I’ve had leadership experience on the chapter, state, and district levels of the fraternity. I’ve also had leadership experience with other such organizations as the Baptist Laymen Ministry and Life Savers Mentorship Program.
